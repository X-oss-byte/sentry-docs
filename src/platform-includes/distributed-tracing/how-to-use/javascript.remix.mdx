If you use the current version of our Remix SDK, distributed tracing just works out of the box for the client and server

For client-side you might have to define `tracePropagationTargets` to get around possible [Browser CORs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues.

```tsx
// entry.client.tsx
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://myproject.org",
    "https://.*.otherservice.org/.*",
  ],
});
```

If you however use version `7.57.x` or below, you need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing to work.
